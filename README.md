==========================================

Directory Structure
===================
-> Three Directories are included here

	1. Working Code and codes during the development of project.
	2. Library for sensor
	3. Decision Tree Algorith implementation

Compilation and Run
===================
	1. Keep the working code files in the MicroSD Card of the Raspberry PI
	2. Start the Raspberry PI and wait for the Login screen to come up
	3. Login into the Raspberry PI with the credentials
	4. Open the Terminal and go to the code directory
	5. Run the following command
		python main.py
